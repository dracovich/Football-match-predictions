# EPL and SPD football match predictions

Playing around with R working with data i find interesting, i've downloaded the match data from football-data.co.uk, and worked it into a datamart that averages the results of the past 5 games  for each team, and then creates variables that are the ratio of the hometeam to the awayteam. These variables are then used to try and create prediction algorithms.

The specific club is not taken into account, in order to try and give a larger amount of data, rather we only look at things such as average shots on goal, shots on target, yellow cards, goals, points, league position etc.
